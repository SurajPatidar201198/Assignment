In these problem set, I have classified document Images on the basis of different-different categories such as whether it is an email or poster or letter and like that there are 16 categories.In these I am using Keras pre-trained model i.e Xception. Although the accuracy was not up to the mark as I am not training it on any cloud platform so the I have used very less number of training,validating and testing images.I am very sure that if we will increase all these parameters size or images then accuracy rate will go high.
