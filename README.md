In these problem set, I have classified document Images on the basis of different-different categories such as whether it is an email or poster or letter and like that there are 16 categories.In these I am using Keras pre-trained model i.e Xception. Although the accuracy was not up to the mark but any how I have maintained it to 26% as I am training it on any cloud platform so the I have used very less number of training,validating and testing images.I am very sure that if we will increase all these parameters size or images then accuracy rate will go high as because of laptop specification constraints I have used in few images in all the categories.
